    "overview": "SnagFixr is a professional execution service built to solve friction that stalls scaling startups. It specializes in resolving bottlenecks in operations, sourcing, production, usability, and GTM (go-to-market) flows.

    "sample_case_study": "A VC-funded D2C startup had delayed its first 1,000-unit production run due to misaligned vendor specs, missing QC protocols, and no pilot testing system. SnagFixr dropped in, restructured vendor SLAs, set up first-article inspections, onboarded a new backup factory, and launched the pilot in 11 days. The fix cut launch delay by 45 days and prevented \u20b932L in RTO/rework losses."
